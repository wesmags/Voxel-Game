# Voxel-Game
A current Work in Progress Voxel Game. 

A voxel game in which players can build and destroy the world in a 3D environment. Highly Detailed and finer graphics compared to other blockier voxel games like Minecraft, pixArk, and Trove.
Created using the Unity Engine. Although work has begun on a seperate custom engine built with OpenGL and C++.
